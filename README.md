# Auth Sessions

> ðŸš§ NOTE, this library is pre-1.0.0, and should not be considered stable.

This library is designed to provide a simple and extensible session based authentication solution for web applications.

Currently, it's only designed to work with axum and rocket and handles registration (including password requirement validation), login, logout, and middleware authentication, all batteries included.
